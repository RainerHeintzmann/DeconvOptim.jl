abstract = {We study the numerical performance of a limited memory quasi-Newton method for large scale optimization, which we call the L-BFGS method. We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.},

Performance is tested by simulated three-dimensional imaging with a fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscope. Results are compared with those for algorithms that use Gaussian or entropy penalty terms, which we derived previously \[J. Opt. Soc. Am. A14, 1696 (1997)\]. The algorithms based on Good's roughness yield superior results. An example is given of the restoration of an image of a biological specimen.},

 abstract = {Given a number of observations x1, ..., xN, a nonparametric method is suggested for estimating the entire probability density curve. The method is to subtract a roughness penalty from the log likelihood, where the roughness penalty is a certain functional of the assumed density function f. Those used are linear combinations of ∫ γ'2 dx and ∫ γ"2 dx, where γ = √ f. The method appears to be consistent under wide conditions, although consistent methods can be rough. Numerical examples are given and show that for certain values of the coefficient in this linear expression the density function turns out to be very smooth even when N is small. Multivariate extensions are proposed, including one to distributions having some continuous and some discrete components, but numerical examples of these have not been tried. Some of the techniques are borrowed from quantum mechanics and tensor calculus.},

abstract = {The ability of iteratively constrained maximum likelihood (ML) deconvolution to reconstruct out-of-band information is discussed and exemplified by simulations. The frequency dependent relative energy regain, a novel way of quantifying the reconstruction ability, is introduced. The positivity constraint of ML deconvolution allows reconstructing information outside the spatial frequency bandwidth which is set by the optical system. This is demonstrated for noise-free and noisy data. It is also shown that this property depends on the type of object under investigation. An object is constructed where no significant out-of-band reconstruction is possible. It is concluded that in practical situations the amount of possible out-of-band reconstruction depends on the agreement between reality and the model describing “typical objects” incorporated into the algorithm by appropriate penalty functions.}
